# clWiki

clWiki is a tired, old wiki, written when Ruby was still new to the West
(started on 1.6.8) and to my brain, and it shows. Please do not look too
closely at this code, and if you need a real wiki, this is not the wiki
you are looking for.

The old, haggard CGI version is now in the `legacy-cgi` branch. `master`
has an attempt at porting this stupid thing to Rails 4. Probably would be
simpler to port my content rather than the wiki - but what the hell.
