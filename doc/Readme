===About formatter plug-ins

Formatters exist in files in the ./format directory. To write your own,
just look at one that's in there and copy the structure - should be
straight-forward. Only other requirement is that the name of the file start
with format and a period (format.whatever.rb). To disable any formatters
that come with clWiki, simply rename/delete the appropriate file from
this directory, or rem out the ClWikiCustomFormatters.instance.register
line at the bottom of the formatter file. 

*** Some formatters come disabled out of the box ***

Check for the ClWikiCustomFormatters.instance.register line in the format
file. (Should probably make this a .conf option).

===About GraphViz Integration
