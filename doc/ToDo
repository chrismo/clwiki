===To Do

====OPEN

* try to recreate the recursive bit by showing pages -- does any indexing
  action from the recent index with multiple pages on the same time, cause
  the weird tree behavior bug? 
 

====A
* wikilinks inside a simpletable are not rendered after the change in when
  custom renderers are processed (fixed, right?)

* Why is a new file not indexed in recent changes? It's only indexed after
  an edit...

* Add option for _ as a Wiki_Name qualifier? (already working? Yeup, as
  long as there's more than one capital somewheres...) -- [make it work
  with one capital and one _]

* add auto-rendering of http:// that's outside a tag

* BUG: Global links are not rendered when the page is displayed right after
  an edit. Reload the page, and there they are. (index locking issue?)
  (it seems that global links to direct pages always render, but global
  links to the find results suffer this bug ... need to verify)
  [I believe this got fixed by accident when I had other need to fix the
   index locking issues -- adding hits. Index supported waiting for locks
   to free, but by default just returns ... added in index WAIT flags
   everywhere]

* BUG: title searches with the index do not AND partial hits of each term
  together. Problem is clwiki does a normal search, then deletes hits where
  the *whole exact* search phrase does not match the title, rather than
  grepping the hit titles with each search term and AND-ing the sets.

* Allow elimination of auto-forwarding pages in find results. Not only
  reduces redundant hits, but if this lowers the hit count on a page to
  just one, than global page detection can directly link to the one page
  instead of the find results for multiple pages. (Maybe -- the whole
  point of auto-forwarding is to keep permanent the previous link. If 6
  months from now I'm searching for that Foo page I remember, and it
  auto-forwards to something else not having Foo in the name and I
  search for Foo, I still need a hit ... the reason this comes up for me
  is that I usually am auto-forwarding to something with a similar name, or
  exact same name in a different hierarchy, so global links and find results
  give me 'duplicate' appearing results. But an auto forward with
  non-similar names would not have these problems, and fixing the other
  problem would create a new one here).

* Add last updated info (whole standard footer?) to bottom of edit page.

====B
* Add RedCloth plug-in ... Textile (more pop than Dave's rdocing)
  http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/yaml4r/redcloth-2.0.tar.gz

* Add easy way to post back to author in blogki

* Allow easy access to Wiki view from Blogki (the only difference, though,
  is the Recent page showing only published articles).

* Allow option to view titles only or full articles on Recent page.
  (In footer do: Recent <a href...>Titles</a> <a href...>Full</a>
   OR
   add link at top of Recent page to toggle to the other view?)

* Allow option to return full page on Find view, or just context
  lines on Find view (allow these options from the Find Results
  page as well -- sync as much with Recent page as possible, lots
  of overlap)

* Render space in between each hierarchy in the link on Find/Recent
  results so longer hierarchies can word wrap within their cell
  (unless this looks too stupid). Or do as is done in the header
  of main pages. (Does global linking help here? Can we just render the
  page name without the hierarchy now that we can find that?)

* Allow for spaced return of page names for better readability

* bug ... \ doesn't subpage correctly. \SubPage is treated as //SubPage
  Get the tests back up to snuff on this.


====C
* Recent needs paging to go to further depths (30-60, etc.)

* rename NoWikiLinks to NoWiki, still support NoWikiLinks, make it case
  insensitive

* Add simple find query string for simple interface (like RubLog's
  =Text dealy?)

* Add encryption option for page contents

* Netscape does not assume <a href=?page=blah> to be <a href=wiki.rb?page=blah>
  like IE does. Fix this.
  (FIXED in convertToLink, but many places aren't using that - I think this
  is finally fixed, need to do one final code review for places like this).
