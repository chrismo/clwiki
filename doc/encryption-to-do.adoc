Page and File classes need to support this option. This can't just be a
formatter plugin. Formatter plugins alter content read from disk, but aren't
involved in the writing process.

Should there be a plugin for this?

Maybe just Page has support for this, File class should write/read the encrypted
content. Page will encrypt/decrypt.

The Rails app can add user authentication somehow (something basic). Wiki should
still work without any auth for pages that haven't been encrypted.

Cookie/session storage should have the key to decrypt.

`<encrypt>` tag at top of content will be the flag for the Page class to encrypt.
How will it know to decrypt? Encrypted contents have a byte marker?

=== Devise?

Is devise too heavy? I used devise with cashew, right?
