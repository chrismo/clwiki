This can't just be a formatter plugin. Formatter plugins alter content read from
disk, but aren't involved in the writing process.

`<encrypt>` tag at top of content will be the flag for the Page class to
encrypt. How will it know to decrypt? Encrypted contents have a byte marker?

Devise? Um - devise is for one-way digests. We need enc/dec - Lockbox.

Ah, how about an optional `encrypted: true` metadata? Then most of how the tests
and everything work doesn't have to be changed, it can work with some encrypted,
some not.

Encrypt tag would work for formatter plugin, if plugins could be expanded to
support writing as well.

That allows user to control without any additional UI.
