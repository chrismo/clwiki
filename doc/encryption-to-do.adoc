== Encrypting the file data

Two goals:

- data at rest on the hard drive is not plaintext.

- data via the app requires a login so anyone stumbling over the wiki
  has to authenticate themselves.

=== TODO

- design user lockbox to be accessible by the File class
- UI to toggle on/off encrypted metadata
- config setting to have encrypted be the default option or not
  * how does this square with the existing enabling option?
- do not allow use of any index other than in-memory if encryption on
- do not allow more than one user?! :D
- need to backfill encrypting existing pages, including user password
- updated the README (any other docs?)
