If you're used to a more popular wiki, you'll probably be longing for some features that I've managed to do without myself. 

<b>Markup</b> is basic html. Typical wiki things like asterisked lists, indentation, urls being automagically formatted ain't in here. 

One quirky bit has made it into clWiki, that is the simpletable tag. Look at the source here to see it in action:

<blockquote>
<simpletable>
ColA  Col B   Col C
x     y       z
u     v       w
</simpletable>
</blockquote>

A row is a single line of text. A column break is a tab character, two or more spaces or a horizontal bar.

As of 1.13.5, some new shorthand markup was added. 
[]
[ and ] indicates the start of a blockquote section, and [ and ] with a slash in the middle will indicate the end. (see source of this page)
[p]
Add in a 'p' and that will indicate a blockquote/pre section with content auto-escaped. (see source of this page)
[/p]
(Obviously, it'd be nice to have a &lt;raw&gt; tag, or somesuch, to allow me to use [ and ] together.)

<b>WikiLinks</b> are pretty typical, though there's no special syntax for turning a non-camel-cased word into a link. To stop WikiLinks from being rendered, use a NoWikiLinks tag (closing tag to turn linking back on). <NoWikiLinks>FrontPage</NoWikiLinks> won't render, because the tag is turning it off.

<b>Hierarchy and Global linking</b>. One of the more unique things about clWiki is support for full hierarchy. Two slashes starts an absolute reference (//FrontPage). Single slash indicates a sub-page of the current page (/LikeThis). Or, you can go as deep as you want: /LikeThis/AndAgain. 

Full hierarchy creates a problem though: most subpages names are unique throughout the wiki, and having to refer to a full name //AboutClWiki/LikeThis/AndAgain is a pain. So clWiki uses its index to allow you to simply type AndAgain, and a "global link" to the correct page is created. 

If there are multiple hits on a name like AndAgain, clWiki links to the find results page, showing all matching links. So, LikeThis links to the find results showing both //FrontPage/LikeThis and //AboutClWiki/LikeThis.

And finally, to explain the ? link next to the Reload link in the footer, if you're on the //NewPage page, and want to create a subpage also called /LikeThis under //NewPage, but can't because clWiki turns /LikeThis into a global link, click the ? link and the page will be reloaded with a create page ? link right after the global link. Click that ? link, and //NewPage/LikeThis will be created.

After using the full hierarchy support for sometime, I've come to consider FavorShallowHierarchies as a best practice.
