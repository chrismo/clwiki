If you're used to a more popular wiki, you'll probably be longing for some features that I've managed to do without myself.

<b>Markup</b> is basic html. Typical wiki things like asterisked lists, indentation, urls being automagically formatted ain't in here. 

One quirky bit has made it into clWiki, that is the simpletable tag. Look at the source here to see it in action:

<blockquote>
<simpletable>
ColA  Col B   Col C
x     y       z
u     v       w
</simpletable>
</blockquote>

A row is a single line of text. A column break is a tab character, two or more spaces or a horizontal bar.

As of 1.13.5, some new shorthand markup was added. 
[]
[ and ] indicates the start of a blockquote section, and [ and ] with a slash in the middle will indicate the end. (see source of this page)
[p]
Add in a 'p' and that will indicate a blockquote/pre section with content auto-escaped. (see source of this page)
[/p]
(Obviously, it'd be nice to have a &lt;raw&gt; tag, or somesuch, to allow me to use [ and ] together.)
[/] 

<b>WikiLinks</b> are pretty typical, though there's no special syntax for turning a non-camel-cased word into a link. To stop WikiLinks from being rendered, use a NoWikiLinks tag (closing tag to turn linking back on). <NoWikiLinks>FrontPage</NoWikiLinks> won't render, because the tag is turning it off.

The legacy CGI version of clWiki supported full hierarchy, but that's no longer supported.
