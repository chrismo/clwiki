[p]
Version 1.13.1 or .2 introduced a change to ClWikiPage.convert_newline_to_br.
Previously, \n was converted to just <br>, but this left the resulting html 
rather unreadable if you ever viewed the source.

This was changed to \n -> <br>\n, but this affected <pre> sections. Now every 
line had <br> and \n and browsers (Mozilla, at least) would render two line 
feeds instead of one.

1.13.3 changed this back and this text here is some testing.

This section is also testing the custom ClWiki tags for a blockquote/pre section.

<pre>
This is a pure pre tag section.
