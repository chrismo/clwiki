- switch to engine not complete:
  - legacy route problem
    - trying to match on the legacy_path not working for some reason
      - isn't 'namespaced'? properly?

  - assets not accessible in dev env. they're name spaced, but nothing's returning them?
    - serve_static_assets appears to default to true down deep - there's no setting in development.rb in dummy app.

  - specs now being run - but problems with legacy, plus the weirdness I had to patch in
    in regard to setting @routes and @controller.default_url_options. Is the intent to
    write engine controller tests inside the dummy app?
